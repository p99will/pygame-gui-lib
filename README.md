# pygame gui lib
 libiary to kick start the use of pygame

I made this small libary to speed up the development of small projects that work well with a GUI interface.

Please refer to the example.py for use on the lib.

Feel free to comment or suggest edits, Currently this lib does all I need it to.
So I might not be adding to it much.
